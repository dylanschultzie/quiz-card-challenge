## Welcome to my Rise challenge submission!

I chose to re-implement the Knowledge Check Block.

### Getting Started

The steps to run the project are as follows:

For the server:

1. Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`
1. Install node modules: `npm i`
1. Run the server (on PORT 5000): `npm start`

For the client (ideally in a separate terminal):

1. Navigate to the client directory: `cd client`
1. Install node modules: `npm i`
1. Run the client (on PORT 3000): `npm start`
